Pointers are special variables that hold the address of another variable. They are written with an asterisk before the variable name and let you access and change memory directly. Pointers are usually used for when you need faster performance, need to work with certain types of code, or are doing low-level memory tasks. However because pointers can skip safety checks and may cause problems with memory or security, you have to mark their use as unsafe and your project needs to allow for unsafe code.
